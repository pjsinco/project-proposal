# I Got a Basketball Jones

### Background and motivation
We like college basketball. We follow it on TV, on the Web and in newspapers. We read game summaries and analysis, pore over box scores, fret over the standings and chew on statistics. 

The season is soon ending. Before long, we'll have an entire season to look back on and try to make sense of. As fans, we're interested in performance--of players, teams, conferences. And we're interested in comparing performance.

### Project objectives
College basketball junkies love statistics. But data, as found on popular sites like ESPN.com, Yahoo! Sports and Sports-Reference.com, as well as in newspapers, have one thing in common: They're tabular. Apparently, that is by convention. We'd like to reinvent descriptive statistics for college basketball as visualizations.

For this project, we'd like visually contextualize the performance of all 351 Division-1 teams, 32 conferences, and more than 4,000 players in the 2013-14 season. 

For player entities, attributes include routine statistical categories like points per game, rebounds, assists. For team entities, the attributes can include those as well as, across the course of the season, winning percentage, position in polls, RPI ratings, winning streaks, conference standing. For conferences, we can look at points and other usual statistical categories, in addition to winning percentage, poll representation, RPI ratings and record against other conferences.

The question we want to answer: How does the performance of this team, this player, this conference measure up?

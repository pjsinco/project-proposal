       FAIRLY OR NOT, newspapermen through the years have been stereotyped as cranky, hard-drinking, and profane.<br />
       Road-weary baseball players, meanwhile, have been tagged with a similar reputation, enhanced by tales of womanizing.<br />
       Henry Chadwick did not fit either mold. But he did leave his cternal stamp on both the newspaper industry and the baseball fraternity. Chadwick -- a late 19th century journalist who subscribed to a regimen of Turkish baths, strong religion, and clean living -- is credited with devising the first baseball box score.<br />
       Since his invention debuted over 130 years ago, baseball fans have fallen in love with the agatesized statistical summary, making it a staple of newspaper sports sections in spring and summer.<br />
       Crammed with names, numbers, and abbreviations, the box score recounts a game, using cryptic rows and columns that can be deciphered to tell how a contest was decided, and how individual batters and pitchers performed.<br />
       Newspaper coverage of baseball, almost nonexistent before Chadwick's box score, virtually exploded on the heels of his invention. And today, the "box" remains the backbone of baseball reporting.<br />
       For baseball readers, the box score is a basic "touchstone with their sport," says Gene Policinski, former managing editor/sports for USA Today. "One of the most cherished aspects of the game."<br />
       America's game. The national pastime.<br />
       How ironic that it was devised by Chadwick, an Englishman.<br />
       Chadwick, the son of a British newspaper editor, emigrated to Brooklyn, N.Y., when he was 13 and soon followed in his father's footsteps as a journalist.<br />
       A contributor to many New York newspapers during his early career, Chadwick composed the first box score in 1859, after watching a baseball game in south Brooklyn between two local teams, the Excelsiors and Stars. It was published in the New York Clipper, a popular sports and amusement weekly where he worked.<br />
       Chadwick's box score listed the names and positions of the players, followed by five columns that recorded the number of hits, runs, putouts, assists, and errors for each man. The inning-by-inning score was underneath, along with a few additional details, including the name of the umpire and the duration of the game -- three hours.<br />
       (A few statistical summaries of baseball games were published prior to Chadwick's box score. But because they are scanty in comparison, Chadwick is considered the creator of the modern box -- the "real simon-pure discoverer and inventor," according to one age-old baseball publication.)<br />
       Chadwick said he devised his box score so that fans could measure the merits of individual players by comparing their game-by-game performances. And it did not take long for his concept to take hold.<br />
       New York Clipper, for example, ran several dozen box scores per issue during the 1870s. And by the time the National League was founded in 1876, boxes were in everyday use by many eastern newspapers. Later, with the advent of wire services, box scores became even more widespread.<br />
       Although it remains a revered element of today's sports page, the box score has not survived without changes. It has undergone many face lifts, adapting to the whims of sports editors and the demands of readers.<br />
       Many of the changes have been the nip-and-tuck variety -- minor, gradual changes like the inclusion of attendance figures and the on-again, off-again, on-again presence of umpires names.<br />
       More significant changes have included the addition of columns for at-bats and runs batted in; the elimination of putout, assist and error totals beside each player's name in the lineup; and, perhaps most importantly, the addition of pitching statistics.<br />
       Numbers came, numbers went. But the box score has always remained readily identifiable. And true to the original mission ordained by Chadwick.<br />
       Probably the most dramatic change has come during this decade, when USA Today and the Associated Press began offering "expanded" box scores. (AP still offers a standard-size-box, too.)<br />
       Nearly twice the length of the traditional box score, the expanded version is an agate monster that appears ready to burst at the seams. While the expanded box still fits into a tidy space on the sports page -- generally taking up no more than a two-by-six-inch hole -- it is much more overwhelming than it was in Chadwick's day.<br />
       Some of the new statistics in the expanded box scores are incredibly minute, particularly to the casual baseball fan. For example, most expanded boxes tell you the number of pitches thrown by a moundsman, right down to the number of strikes. They also indicate whether run-scoring hits are delivered with two outs, and who grounded into double plays.<br />
       That's nitty-gritty.<br />
       Even Paul Montella, the sports agate editor for the Associated Press, admits the plethora of statistics borders on the extreme.<br />
       "Some of the information, I think, is valuable. But some of the information," he says, his voice trailing off with skepticism.<br />
       Given his affinity for baseball statistics, Chadwick would probably drool over the expanded box scores if he could see them today. However, he might not like the reason for their development.<br />
       Both Policinski and Montella admit hat the expanded boxes were made available partly because of the rising public interest in game statistics used for fantasy baseball leagues. Participants in fantasy leagues choose baseball players for their own imaginary teams, then vie against each other based on the performance of those players -- often with money at stake. The expanded box scores allow fantasy leaguers to follow their players more closely.<br />
       The bearded, gentlemanly Chadwick deplored gambling on baseball, and as a[cont. on p.43] journalist railed against "pool selling" at baseball games.<br />
       His crusade attracted other journalists and eventually led to the abolishment of the practice. To Chadwick, the elimination of gambling was necessary to ensure that bookies would not infiltrate the game.<br />
       While fantasy leagues probably offer no real threat to the integrity of today's game -- they're often comprised of a handful of office mates or neighborhood chums -- it is debatable whether Chadwick would have approved. As one baseball chronicler put it, Chadwick had a "violent hatred" for any gambling in connection with baseball.<br />
       That rigidity once prompted Chadwick's brother Edwin, who was knighted by Queen Victoria for his work as sanitary commissioner of London, to quip: "While I have been trying to clean London, my brother has been keeping up the family reputation by trying to clean your sports."<br />
       But Chadwick's bid to remove gambling from baseball, and his invention of the box score, comprise only part of his legacy as a journalist. In fact, he practically pioneered baseball reporting as a profession.<br />
       The Sporting News has lauded him as "the man who founded the profession and practiced in it for 55 years."<br />
       Chroniclers say Chadwick was inspired to write about baseball immediately after his first brush with the sport in 1856. The event has been described as a magical epiphany: Chadwick was at Elysian Fields in Hoboken, N.J., to cover a cricket match when he happened upon a baseball game. He was so enthralled that he "then and there resolved" to report on baseball and make it the national game, relates a well-worn, unidentified newspaper article in the Baseball Hall of Fame archives.<br />
       A turn-of-the-century letter by P.T. Powers, former president of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, recalls how Chadwick's experience at Elysian Fields prompted him to return to the managing editor of the New York Times to seek permission to cover baseball for the paper.<br />
       Until then, Chadwick, a former music teacher, had been covering cricket and other sporting events for the Times and had done some general articles for the Long Island Star. Baseball, finally, gave him his niche.<br />
       His first baseball article was published by the New York Times in 1857. From there, he became, according to one chronicler, a "one-man baseball press association," peddling scores and stories to the Times and other papers throughout the city. Though reluctant at first, papers caved to Chadwick's persistence and the public's growing interest in baseball; after initially allowing just a few lines for Chadwick's reports, they began offering more space.<br />
       Soon, papers were forced to hire their own baseball reporters. By 1858, Chadwick himself was steadily employed as baseball writer for the New York Clipper, where he also laid claim to the title of baseball editor. Before Chadwick, such job descriptions were virtually nonexistent.<br />
       Chadwick, who was also one of the first sportswriters to adopt a byline, didn't confine himself to the Clipper. Throughout his 30-year association with the paper, he worked for several other publications, most notably the Brooklyn Eagle, a nationally recognized daily. There, he served principally as baseball writer and sports editor, his time on staff ranging from 1864-94.<br />
       He also contributed baseball writings to the New York Tribune, where he had earlier worked as a Civil War correspondent, as well as to New York's Evening Telegram, Herald, Mercury, Morning World, and Sun. In addition, he was editor of the first weekly newspaper devoted exclusively to baseball, the Ball Players' Chronicle, which was published from June 1867 to July 1869.<br />
       Over the years, Chadwick gained a reputation as a fierce reporter, committed to elevating the game of baseball and ready to criticize whatever stood in the way. That meant attacking not only gambling, but also rowdyism among players -- both on and off the field.<br />
       In 1867, for example, Chadwick wrote that a baseball player "must comport himself like a gentleman on all occasions, but especially on match days."<br />
       The ballplayer, he wrote, "abstains from profanity and its twin and evil brother obscenity, leaving these vices to be ... cultivated by graduates of our penitentiaries."<br />
       Indeed, it was not uncommon for Chadwick to moralize. A longtime opponent of Sunday baseball, he also lashed out against drinking and womanizing by players.<br />
       By 1894, Chadwick had largely retired from the New York newspaper scene to concentrate on writing baseball for two of the largest weekly sports publications in the country: Sporting Life, published in Philadelphia; and the Sporting News, out of St. Louis.<br />
       Although Chadwick continued to moralize, he was more writer than preacher He reported on baseball in exacting detail, also using his writing to offer opinions on playing techniques and suggest rule changes.<br />
       Such contributions earned him national recognition. He was the only journalist awarded a medal of achievement at the 1904 World's Fair in St Louis; and that same year, he received a letter from President Theodore Roosevelt, congratulating him on his 80th birthday and his work.<br />
       When Chadwick died at the age of 84, he was eulogized as "The Father of Baseball, Father Chadwick."<br />
       He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn, along with other great journalists like Horace Greeley and James Gordon Bennett, founders of the New York Tribune and New York Herald, respectively.<br />
       And he is enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., for service to baseball "apart from playing the game" -- his bronze plaque hanging only a few feet from the plaques of Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and Cy Young.<br />
       It lauds him as "inventor of the box score," reminding us that "Pop" Chadwick's best memorial can be found every spring and summer, in rows and columns of agate, in the sports pages.<br />

       Baseball box scores have come a long way since they were devised by 19th century journalist Henry Chadwick. Today, many newspapers have expanded their box scores to meet the rising public interest for more game statistics to use in fantasy baseball leagues.<br /></p><p>WBN: 9716503484004
